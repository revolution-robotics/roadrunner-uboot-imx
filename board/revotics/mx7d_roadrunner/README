Building U-Boot
---------------

$ make mrproper

Choose one of the following:
$ make mx7d_roadrunner_defconfig			# For booting from SD card/eMMC

$ make


Flashing U-Boot to an SD card
-----------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, flash the generated SPL & U-Boot
binaries into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=69; sync

Alternatively, when building U-Boot without SPL (for reference only):
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync

(replace /dev/sdX with your correct device node)

- Insert the SD card into the slot

- Connect the debug cable to the host PC

- Make sure the boot select switches are on SD

- Power up the board and U-Boot messages will appear in the serial console.
